# LogisticRegression
Heights and Weights Using Logistic Regression

# Summary

The purpose of this project is to classify people by gender given only their height and weight. 

Classification tries to predict, which of a small set of classes, an observation belongs to. Mathematically, the aim is to find y, a label based on knowing a feature vector x. For instance, consider predicting gender from seeing a person's face, something we do fairly well as humans. To have a machine do this well, we would typically feed the machine a bunch of images of people which have been labelled "male" or "female" (the training set), and have it learn the gender of the person in the image from the labels and the features used to determine gender. Then, given a new photo, the trained algorithm returns us the gender of the person in the photo.

With a scatter plot of height vs. weight, the fact that a line can be drawn to separate the two classes makes the problem linearly separable. Support Vector Machines (SVM) are an example of a maximum-margin classifier.
